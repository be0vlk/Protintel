# PROTINTELLIGENCE üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
**ProtINTelligence** is a Python script for the **OSINT &amp; Cyber Community**. This repo is a fork of the original project by C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy. It's main changes are enchanced usability by accepting command line arguments and files as input.<br>


## What can this tool do so far? 
  
**Protintelligence is currently working perfectly for checking any domain** to see if this domain uses protonmail to send and receive emails.
<br>
Input example: ```test@fornever.me```
  
<br>
  
With the input above, this tool will be able to:
   - **Confirm** if the custom domain uses Protonmail to send and receive emails
   - **Detect** if the custom domain is using a **catch-all** and provide you with the main email address.
   - **Provide** you with PGP key creation date and time (This is often the same date & time as account creation because not many people change their keys)
   - **Provide** the Key Encryption Type: RSA	or ECC (Curve25519)
   - **Get** PGP Key information + creation date and time for any protonmail email address (protonmail.ch, protonmail.com, proton.me, pm.me)
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the protonmail address exists because the protonmail API response to non-valid email addresses also shows PGP key with a randomized creation date and time.
